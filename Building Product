## Michael Siebel

- What problem are you solving?
    - Can you state the problem clearly in 1-2 sentences?
    - Have you experienced the problem yourself?
    - Can you define this problem narrowly?
    - Is the problem solvable?

- Who is your customer?
    - Not everyone
    - How often does your user have a problem?
    - How intense is the problem?
        - Low frequence, low intensity = Not a good problem
    - Are they willing to pay?
    - How easy are they to find?

- Does your MVP actually solve the problem that you want to solve?

- Which customers should you go after first?
    - The easiest/desperate ones first

- Identify bad customers - Which customers should you run away from?

- Don't discount or start with a low price
    - unless it's part of the sale
    
- How to set up metrics
    - Event based metrics for UX behavior
        - Mixpanel, Amplitude, Heap
    - Pick 5-10 important metrics
    - Make measurement part of the product spec

- Product Development Cycle (V1)
    - Set a KPI Goal
        - Should almost always be revenue
        - or Usage if you don't charge customers money
        - If investor asks for KPI - should not only say metric, but where it is now, where it was 3 months ago, and where it was when started
    - Brainstorm ideas to move KPI
    - Set Easy/Medium/Hard table
        - Hard should be started first
    - Must write the spec

- Pivot vs Iterate
    - Pivot - changing the customer and/or the problem
        - This should be rare, means you should start a new company
    - Iterate - changing the solution
