## Talk by David Rusenko

- **Create a market**
    - Find a hidden need
    - Where are you getting pulled. Find ways people are hacking your product to choose direction

- **How to build a remarkable product**
    1. Talk to customers and develop a market thesis
    2. Listen to their problems, not solutions
    3. Rapid prototyping and user testing
        - Building a fully functional product for testing isn't right
        - Focus on getting to a functional prototype as quickly as possible
        - Don't worry about scaling until you need to
        - Expect many iterations
            - Build team that can do this quickly
    4. Build their solution to their problems
    5. Test solution with them
        - Two solutions:
            1.  Talk to target customers ( be open to changing view on who these people are )
            2. Don't overthink it.
        - Most helpful tools:
            1. Customer interviews (5-10 needed)
            2. UX Testing sessions (3-5 needed)
                - UX Testing Sessions are simple and invaluable
                    1. Get someone to use your app/service in front of you.
                    2. Encourage them to give open and honest feedback
                    3. Ask them to perform a task
                    4. DONT SAY ANYTHING
            3. Metrics - beware of telling too many stories with too little data
    6. Work? No, go to 1

    - **Prioritizing**
        1. Only one thing matters

            Focus only on the things that get you to your next milestone.

        2. Optimize for learning

            Most people prioritize by creating a list sorted by cost x benefit. Instead, ask yourself "what is our biggest unknown that would rewrite our priority list?"

    - **How do I know I've achieved PMF?**
        - Three key metrics
            1. Returning users (Day 1,  3, 7, 30 retention)
                - Biggest indicator things are working
            2. NPS (Should be > 50)
                - Would you recommend this product to a friend (1-10)
                    - % that answer 9-10 are promoters
                    - % that answer 0-6 these are detractors
                    - % that answer 7-8 are thrown out
            3. Paying customer renewal rates
        - Don't pay attention to these metrics
            1. Signups
                - more of a reflection of market fit than PMF. You've identified something people want, but is it the right solution?
            2. Converstion rate
                - All conversion rates start low

    - **Three things a startup needs to do to be successful**
        1. Product that meaningfully better than alternatives
        2. How to acquire customers in a differentiated way that scales
        3. Invent your business model without killing your traction

    - **Scaling the team**
        - Don't do this till you have PMF
        - Don't go past 20 people until you have PMF

    - **Building a Brand**
        - Use your solution to build the brand
            - Great brands are built around customer insight
            - Don't overthink this
