            3. B2B: Do they visit your pricing page?

    2. Is it easy to get started with my product?
        - Ways to measure your product being easy to get started
            1. People who do one valuable thing (ie watch a video, doing a search..)
            2. Measure a funnel of your initial user experience
            3. Speed to doing the valuable thing
    3. Are people coming back to my product?

- You should be able to understand why you're not growing
    - And fix it.

- Tips and Tricks
    - Email and text confimations have a huge drop offs
    - Constantly iterate on your user inital user experience
    - Let users into the product before asking them to sign up
    - RETENTION IS SO IMPORTANT

- Ways to measure people coming back:
    1. New users who came back 1 week + 30 days later to do a valuable thing again
    2. Number of people who use the product *every day* (DAU instead of MAU)
    3. B2B: revenue churn - monthly $ lost in a given month
        - Monthly churn adds up at the end of the year (ie 7% churn is 56% gone at the end of the year)

- Write down all the feedback
- Pick one northstar metric and monitor 3-5 metrics
    - Less is more.
    - Frequent mistake is having too many metrics to monitor.
